Observations:

1) Capomulin and Ramicane show the highest efficacy in reducing tumor volume when looking at Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

2) There is a positive correlation between a mouse's weight in grams and the tumor volume (mm3). However, this may be because the tumor volume is contributing to the mouse's weight.

3) Mouse RR54, treated with the Capomulin drug regimen, showed a significant decrease in tumor volume at Timepoint 5. The reduction in tumor volume began to level out around 34 mm3 (timepoint 25), potentially indicating that there is a limit to the amount the tumor size can be reduced.
